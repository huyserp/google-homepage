As this was an exercise in style and positioning, the functionailty of the search form and links are not present.

the top menu bar links actually go somewhere (usually some main google page) the bottom menu bar links are styled properly but do not link to anything.

I had the most difficulty with positioning the bottom to bars.  They wouldn't stick to the bottom of the page - then I realized the difference between relative and absolute positioning :)

after getting them stuck to the bottom with the appropriate spacing, the next challenge was getting the content (f2left and f2right) from displaying on top of eachother.... this became a matter of establishing the width of footerone and footertwo and stretching the bars the extent of the page....... the simple things that slip from your mind.

I utilized absolute postioning to stick containers appropriately within their boxes, inline-block display and flex display to create horizontal menus.

I'm sure the css is full of redundancies, but its midnight, I'm tired, and it displays the way I want it to.

I'll re-visit this code down the line when I've gained more experience and clean it up :)
